            <p>
               A Free Bird™ is a 501(c)3 nonprofit, arts education organization dedicated to helping young people, ages 4-18, affected by cancer, fight their disease through the therapeutic benefits of the arts.  We do this primarily through progressive, three-stage programming that integrates art therapy with art education and facilitates access to the arts and artistic expression. Our three core programs introduce children to and inspire them to explore the arts (<span class="bold-midle">Dream</span>); match children with artists to educate them in a creative expression of their choice (<span class="bold-midle">Fight Free</span>) and celebrate children as artists by providing them with opportunities to experience life in the artistic field of their choosing, through an exciting day of total immersion (<span class="bold-midle">Free & Free Pro</span>).

            </p>
            <div class="collapse-button-wrap">
                <button class="btn-more collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#more-about"></button>
            </div>
            <div id="more-about" class="collapse">
                <p>
                    A Free Bird believes in the immense power of the arts, and is committed to spreading its healing properties to as many children affected by cancer as possible. We believe too, that children are natural artists, and when provided with the right guidance, will demonstrate exceptional talent. To this end, we offer artistic resources in all art forms, and make them available to children with cancer, their parents and hospitals.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The artistic careers of our young artists are jump-started and nourished through our three core programs: <span class="bold-midle">Dream</span> (inspires children);<span class="bold-midle">Fight Free</span> (educates children); and <span class="bold-midle">Free & Free Pro</span> (celebrates children). We work closely with museums, dance and theatre companies, art schools and local universities, as well as local artists, musicians, actors, art students and other partners to provide art tutors to children, organize and host arts related activities at hospitals, and create opportunities for artistic growth even when cancer is in remission. In addition to our artistic partners, we also receive support from foundations and corporations, whose generous donations help us develop and maintain our programming.

</p>
                <p>
                    A Free Bird was founded and established in New York City in 2008, and became a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization in January 2011.We are headquartered in New York-New Jersey, and are currently building a national and global reach in our effort to provide aid for children undergoing medical treatment around the world.  This year we are planning to open up a branch office in Israel.

                </p>
                <p>
                    A Free Bird is entirely volunteer-based with 100% of all donations and fundraising proceeds going directly towards programming. We were recently recognized by Mayor Bill DeBlasio and NYC Service as one of the city’s most engaged organizations for volunteer service.

        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Our mission is to help children discover the artist within, shape them as artists, and empower each child to fly free.

        </p>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Every day, 43 children are diagnosed with cancer in the United States. Our vision is to reach each of these children in the early stages of cancer, and inspire them to find the artist within, educate them in an art form of their choosing, and celebrate them as the artists they are—and in the process, instill hope and joy.
